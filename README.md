# Developing User Interface Paradigms for Data Visualisation in Room-Scale Virtual Reality Systems

This repo contains the source code to `vr-data`, a piece of software to help visualise large amounts of three-dimensional data in a room-scale virtual reality system, such as the [HTC Vive](http://www.htcvr.com). It is written by [Thomas Pritchard](http://tpritc.com), at [Plymouth University](http://plymouth.ac.uk).
